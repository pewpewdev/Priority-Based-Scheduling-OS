# Priority-Based-Scheduling-OS
About the Project

> In the project we have created priority schedulling algorithm to schedule the processes in a operating system.
> we have try to develope both preemptive schedulling and non-preemptive schedulling.
> The code provides the implementations of the following priority schedulling:
 * low priority as high priority 
 * high priority as high priority

> Turn arround time and Waiting for preemption and non-preemption schedulling is calculated.
> Processes execution is graphically represented using gantt chart.
